# OpenWebTools
----------------------------------
OpenWebTools is a collection of simple tools by https://github.com/IUseDebianBtw 

the original code is by https://github.com/LyubomirT

most of these will be rewrites of LyubomirT code as they are open on replit 
(exception of OpenPassGen check documentation for more info)

-----------------
### why rewrite? 

The source code was not on GitHub or licensed but was open. 

These tools should have been on GitHub and licensed after requests from me (iusedebianbtw) to LyubomirT. 

He kept it in a private repo, so we forked and rewrote it.
